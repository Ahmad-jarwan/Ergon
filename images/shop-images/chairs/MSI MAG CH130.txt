The MAG CH130 X took inspiration from a race car seat, with emphasis on support and comfortability. Body pressure is fully loosened up by the ergonomically streamlined outline, with the backline fully matching the spine and head. The steel material is stable and durable, and the widened and deepened seat provides more complete coverage. You can enjoy the best whether you're in game or at work
